          <h2>All about Biryani</h2>
          Biryani is cooked with the various method, out of which the most popular one is Dum Phukt i.e. a process of cooking on the slow fire. Dum pukht cooking uses a round, heavy-bottomed pot, preferably a handi (clay pot), in which food is sealed and cooked over a slow fire. This is the most popular and traditional method of cooking Biryani but over a period of time, there are many modern techniques developed such as Steamed biryani, Charcoal biryani and Jhatka Biryani.
          Amongst all the Biryani’s, Hyderabadi and Lucknowi or Awadhi Biryani are the most popular ones. India’s love for Biryani makes it the most searched dish of 2019. Not just any Biryani, specifically Chicken Biryani has turned out to be the most searched Indian food globally in 2019. A study by SEMrush found that chicken biryani had an average of 4.56 lakh searches each month. As per the study, Butter Chicken was second on the list, followed by Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, Dosa, Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, Naan, Dal Makhani, and chaat. Butter Chicken, which every person in Northern India swears by, was searched at an average almost four lakh times, while one of the most common and popular snacks, Samosa was searched an average of 3.9 lakh times. Chicken Tikka Masala was searched an average of 2.5 lakh times, the study showed.
          Chef Suvir Saran adds, “Biryani is the mirror image of our population and as the clock is ticking, its a test of time. Biryani has survived longer than any Human being, it will live forever because of its history, taste and texture.”
